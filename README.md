If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

Start at the Root App.js gets hit first

- set up cookie parser middleware and routes for restaurants and users

- Then app.js sends us to the controller

**controller || userService.js depending on the route** - login will go userService - Reviews for restaurants are not userService dependent

**User Routes** (the mores challenging)

- POST /api/v1/users
  Creates a new user - needs token(cookie)
  Should error if the email already exists
  Should immediately log in the user

  0.  authenticate lets you in the club

- POST /api/v1/users/sessions Logs in an existing user
  Should error if email / password don‚Äôt match
- GET /api/v1/users Shows list of users Protected
  must be admin 2
  authorized middleware here - for VIP

**Restaurant Routes**

- GET /api/v1/restaurants Shows list of restaurants Not Protected 2
- GET /api/v1/restaurants/:restId Shows restaurant detail Not Protected,
  Includes nested list of reviews 3
- POST /api/v1/restaurants/:restId/reviews Creates a new review Protected,
  defaults user_id to the logged in user.
  Body of request should have the following shape
  {stars: 5, detail: 'It was okay'}

-DELETE /api/v1/reviews/:id Deletes a review Protected ‚Äì
must be an admin or the user who created the review 2
